# Atomic_Mapping

## 1. Binary file "atomic_mapping_fmcs_limited.exe" 
###    -> only work for "1 reactant to 1 product" reaction SMILES with string length of 100 and 101 (limited version is provided for only test purpose)
##
## 2. Test input file "reaction_SMILES.txt"
###    -> input file name should be "reaction_SMILES.txt", in which the file includes reaction SMILES with string length of 100 and 101 from USPTO
##
## 3. Test output file "mapped_reaction_smarts.txt"
###    -> test output file generated by binary file using the test input file 
##
## 4. Example input file "reaction_SMILES_uspto.txt"
###    -> This file includes 100 "1 reactant to 1 product" and "2 reactants to 1 product" reaction SMILES without string length limit from USPTO
##
## 5. Example output file "mapped_reaction_smarts_uspto.txt"
###    -> This output file generated by binary file (unlimited version which is not provided here) using the example input file
